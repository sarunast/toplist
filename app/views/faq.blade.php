            Why should you choose TamyTop over our competitors?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our website provides up time (a measurement of the percentage of your server that is online and offline in a 24 hour period), rank (your position within TamyTop), vote and click statistics (how many votes and how many users clicked on your server per day), all free of charge! These features will give users information to help them judge various servers also using TamyTop. Live statistics are also available, gathered via your IP and Port, which show whether the server is up or down, how many players are online, and much more....
